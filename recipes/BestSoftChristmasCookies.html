    <h6>SUGAR COOKIES RECIPE</h6>
    <p>A Christmas cookie recipe for soft sugar cutouts that I have used for years. I sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar before baking; you can also frost them with icing when cool.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: These classic Christmas cookies start with all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes the cookies rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li>Sugar and margarine: White sugar is beaten with margarine. You can use butter if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and bind the dough together.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract is the perfect finishing touch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How To Make Chritmas Cookie</h3>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these
    Christmas cookies:</p>
